NewRelic alerts via SMS
=========================

Forwarding NewRelic alerts via SMS  

    With NewRelic webhooks, one can write a custom web app to play with alerts.  
    Here is an attempt to send an SMS whenever we receive an alert.  
    

    NewRelic doesnt give us a interface to add users to a plugin's alerts, this  
    project gives a web and REST api based interface to manage users data and   
    plugin alerts.
